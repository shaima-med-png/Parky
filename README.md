Parking Management System
This project is a Parking Management System developed as part of my first-year Computer Science coursework. Written in C, it demonstrates basic programming concepts, such as control structures, functions, and file handling. The system is designed to simulate the management of parking spaces, including features like:

Adding new vehicles to the parking lot.
Tracking available spots in real-time.
Generating reports of parked vehicles.
Features:
-User-friendly menu-based interface.
-Storage of parking data using text files for persistence.
-Simple and efficient algorithms for vehicle entry and exit management.

Purpose
Parky helped me explore the fundamentals of C programming and apply problem-solving skills to a real-world scenario. It also serves as a stepping stone to more complex projects in the future.
